***Notes***: 

* The environment was set up using GMS version 2022.9.1.51. 
* I take no credit for the assets or the concepts.
* All I have provided are the assets from the tutorial and the preferences for GML code (not visual).
* My goal is to provide a template that a student can clone to follow along with Shaun and practice using Source Control Management along the way.
